# vote-tracker
Tracks user votes for cat pictures. Two random images are displayed. When the user clicks on one, the image is highlited and a vote button appears. When the button is clicked, a vote is tallied for the highlited cat and two more random images are displayed.  The running vote total for each cat is displayed underneath its picture.
